Turinguinho is a little robot inspired by Alan Turing. It shares texts, articles, news, and features from different sources designed to challenge conventional thinking about the world of Artificial Intelligence and Computing and its impact on society, culture and business.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

To get Turinguinho up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    * Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:
  
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Open the `.env` file and add the values for the following variables:
  
        * `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`: The ID of the Discord channel where the bot will post.
        * `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (venv):**
    * Create the virtual environment (if you don't already have a `venv` directory):
    
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    * Activate the virtual environment:
        * On Windows (cmd.exe):

            ```bash
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        * On Windows (PowerShell):

            ```powershell
            .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
            ```
        * On macOS and Linux:

            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * With the virtual environment activated, install all the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

All set! After this, you should be able to run the main project script. üéâ
